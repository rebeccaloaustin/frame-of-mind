        Welcome to Frame of Mind, where art meets attitude! Prepare to embark on a
        journey through a whimsical wonderland of creativity and chaos, where every
        brushstroke tells a story and every sculpture has a secret. At Frame of Mind,
        we've curated an eclectic collection of artworks that'll make you think,
        laugh, and maybe even scratch your head in confusion. From the classics to the
        quirky, our gallery has something for everyone, whether you're a seasoned art
        connoisseur or just looking for a good laugh. But we're not just here to
        showcase artâ€”we're here to shake things up! Got an artist or artwork that's
        been living rent-free in your mind? Share it with us, and let's add some color
        to this canvas we call life. So, strap in, buckle up, and get ready to have
        your mind blown (figuratively, of course) at Frame of Mind!
